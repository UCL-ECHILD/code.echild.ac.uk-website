Welcome to the ECHILD Phenotype Code List Repository. Here you will find phenotype code lists, documentation and example code for implementation in Stata and R. While these resources have been developed to aid the ECHILD research community, you are free to use the Repository to support other research and uses of data. We also hope that this website will serve as a bit of a [primer on phenotyping](primer.qmd) in administrative data. The Repository is provided without any warranty.

The Phenotype Code List Repository has been designed according to a [set of principles](principles.qmd) that are intended to make finding, understanding and using phenotype code lists easier.

This website is under construction. For any queries or suggestions, please contact

ECHILD is [Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data](https://www.echild.ac.uk), which links the National Pupil Database and Hospital Episode Statistics plus other relevant datasets) for all of England.
