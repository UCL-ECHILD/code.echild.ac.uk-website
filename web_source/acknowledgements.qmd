The Repository launched in August 2024 and was designed by [Matthew Jay](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/60536-matthew-jay){target="_blank"}, who also wrote the content for this website and the R code. Technical aspects of the website were initially supported by [Tony Stone](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/92864-tony-stone){target="_blank"}. [Kate Lewis](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/58088-kate-lewis){target="_blank"} is working on converting the R scripts into Stata do files. We would also like to thank the following who have served as second checkers of code list files:

While this website and the format of the code lists in the Repository are our work, all the code lists included in the Repository were originally created by others. The documentation for each includes the authors and a link to the original place of publication.

The ECHILD project is in partnership with NHS England and the Department for Education (DfE) and we thank the following individuals for their valuable contributions to the project: Jodie Taylor-Brown, Ian Goodwin, Garry Coleman, Richard Caulton, Catherine Day (NHS England), and Gary Connell, Harriet Fearn, Kirsty Knox (DfE). We are also grateful to Bill South and Alan Cotterill from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for providing the Trustworthy Research Environment for ECHILD.

We thank all the children, young people, parents and carers who contributed to the ECHILD project. We also gratefully acknowledge all children and families whose de-identified data form this research database.
