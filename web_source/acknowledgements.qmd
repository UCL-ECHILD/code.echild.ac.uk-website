The Repository launched in August 2024 and was designed by [Matthew Jay](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/60536-matthew-jay){target="_blank"}, who also wrote the content for this website and who is currently working on the example R code. He also formatted and checked the code lists that were included in the Repository when it launched. The technical aspects of the website were initially supported by [Tony Stone](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/92864-tony-stone){target="_blank"}.

While this website and the format of the code lists in the Repository are our work, all the code lists included in the Repository were originally created by others. The documentation for each includes the authors and a link to the original place of publication.

This Repository is supported by ADR UK (Administrative Data Research UK), an Economic and Social Research Council (part of UK Research and Innovation) programme (ES/V000977/1, ES/X000427/1 and ES/X003663/1).
