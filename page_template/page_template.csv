This was included originally as Herbert et al were looking at adolescents and any smoking was deemed to be relevant. However, there was a change in guidance at some point after the code list was developed, when it was noted that any tobacco use will always have an adverse effect on health (https://classbrowser.nhs.uk/ref_books/ICD-10_2024_5th_Ed_NCCS.pdf, p 88). So, the guidance is that this code should always be used for current smokers, and this has led to a huge increase in the use of this code (https://www.rcp.ac.uk/media/bdnj2ykk/hiding-in-plain-sight.pdf, pp 167-8). Studies using this code must therefore consider the extent to which changes over time are reflective of changes in coding practice vs the underlying prevalence of smoking.","Code I42.1 (obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) was included in the original documentation but this should be I42.6 (alcoholic cardiomypoathy).
