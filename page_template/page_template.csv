The basic logic is that an episode is a stress-related presentation if it has one of the codes recorded in the first diagnostic position or if a self-harm code is recorded in any diagnostic position. When grouping, where a self-harm code is present, the episode would be classed as a self-harm episode. In the original classification, there are some codes (T36-T50 and some codes from the S block) that are only valid in the first diagnostic position AND where a self-harm code is recorded in any position. Because a self-harm code will always count as a stress-related presentation, these codes are essentially redundant, at least for the purposes of identifying any stress-related presentation, and the special flag for these codes is ignored in the scripts.  Note also that code Z95.1 appears twice, once under drug/alcohol and once under self-harm. If a self-harm X or Z code is on the same episode, it should be counted as a self-harm code, otherwise as a drug/alcohol code. In the example script, we do not attempt to create mutually exclusive groups or use the categories.

Official guidance is that this code should always be used for current smokers, and this has led to a large increase in the use of this code ([Royal College of Physicians](https://www.rcp.ac.uk/media/bdnj2ykk/hiding-in-plain-sight.pdf){target=""_blank""}, pp 167-8).
